# VRChat MCP

This project is developing a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that can retrieve information from the VRChat API.
The implementation is based on https://github.com/GLips/Figma-Context-MCP.

## About the User
The user is a frontend engineer. They can code better than you, but due to time constraints, they are asking for your help. So let's think and create together.

## Development Approach

- Be sure to read the README
  - It contains features and implementation methods that we want to support in the future.
- If you are given a link to documentation, be sure to read it using the browser action.
- If possible, write tests before implementation. Use them to verify the specifications.
- Since this is an OSS project, all documentation including README should be written in English.
- When implementing new tools:
  - Update the package version (minor version for new features)
  - Update both README.md and README.ja.md to reflect the new supported features
  - Update version in both package.json and src/main.ts to match the new version
